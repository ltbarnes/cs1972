Project: Platformer 2
Student: Logan Barnes (ltbarnes)


COMPILED USING QT 5.2.0!!!


Common Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] Able to load OBJ models using the support code
	### engine/common/OBJ
[ ] Able to render OBJ models using the support code
	### had to to a little adjusting for the new API
[ ] Stores only one copy of any single model (never load the same model twice)
	### engine/common/ObjectHander keeps track of loaded objects

Geometric Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] Analytic collision response
	[ ] Collision response slides for at least N iterations of the sweep test in the plane horizontal to collision (N = 4 is a good value)
		### engine/collisions/GeometricCollisionManager sets the iteration count in the manage() function.
	[ ] Collision response implement with the straight sliding hack for ramps
		### in engine/collisions/GeometricCollisionManager handleCollisions() method

Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] Collision debugger support code is not present
	### couldn't really use it with the new API anyway
[ ] Movement and view controls must be the same as warmup and minecraft (including gravity and jumping)
	### yup. engine/world/Player is a generic class to handle this since it's a requirement for every game.
	### game/platformer/entities/PlatformerPlayer implements the Player class for platformer.
[ ] The camera must be able to use a 3rd-person view
	### press + or - to zoom
[ ] The player must be drawn as an ellipsoid
	### added in the game/platformer/gamescreens/GameScreen adds this in the constructor.
[ ] The game must have a menu screen that allows the player to choose between different levels (different OBJ models)
	### game/platformer/gamescreens/PlatformerMenu
[ ] The player must be able to return to the menu screen without restarting the program
	### press backspace


Issues:

	I'm sure there are plenty of bugs but I haven't noticed any yet in my very limited testing.
	-FPS prints to the console.
	-Compiled with Qt5.2.0
