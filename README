COMPILED USING QT 5.2.0!!!


Geometric Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] Pathfinding and navigation across a loaded navigation mesh
	[ ] Construct a graph from a navigation mesh loaded from an OBJ file
	[ ] Query for the polygon in the mesh directly under a point
	[ ] Search through the graph for a path between two points (feel free to use BFS)
	[ ] Path generation using the simple stupid funnel algorithm

Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] The game must follow all requirements from platformer2
[ ] The player must be able to toggle a visualization of navigation using a key input
	### press 'N'
	[ ] The visualization must render the navigation mesh
		### yep
	[ ] The visualization must render the shortest path from the current player position to a target point
		### yep
	[ ] The target point must be visualized by an ellipsoid (it does not have to collide)
		### yep
	[ ] The player must be able to change the target point by raycasting the environment (place the center at the result)
		### yep
	[ ] The player must be able to change the target point by raycasting the target point (place the center at the result)
		### hold shift then click otherwise it will just raycast the environment again


Issues:

	I'm sure there are plenty of bugs but I haven't noticed any yet in my very limited testing.
	-FPS prints to the console.
	-Compiled with Qt5.2.0

COMPILED USING QT 5.2.0!!!

Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] The game must have at least one type of enemy that uses path-finding over a navigation mesh
[ ] This enemy must interact with the player in some way (e.g. push the player off ledges, shoot at the player, damage the player directly)
[ ] The game must have a non-arbitrary and reasonably achievable win or loss condition
[ ] The game must be resettable upon win or loss without restarting the program
[ ] The game can never enter an unwinnable or unloseable state
[ ] The game must use orthographic projection to display some form of game UI
