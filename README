Project: Minecraft 2
Student: Logan Barnes (ltbarnes)


Common Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] Camera or graphics object supports view frustum culling of axis-aligned bounding boxes
	### in engine/voxel/voxelmanager the graphics object is used to cull the chunks

Voxel Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] Collision detection and sliding response with collided blocks for arbitrary size axis-asligned bounding boxes
	### engine/voxel/voxelmanager handles collisions with chunks
[ ] Per-chunk Vertex Buffer Objects
	### game/world/mcchunkbuilder creates the vbo then gives it to the chunk in the init() function

Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] Movement and view controls must the same as warmup (including gravity and jumping)
	### handled in the game/entities/player class
[ ] The world must consists of a 10x2x10 grid of size C = 32 chunks
	### set in the game/world/minecraftworld constructor
[ ] The game must run at 40+ FPS on department machines: this requirement overrides the standard 30+ FPS requirement


Issues:
	
	-Z face collisions can be a little glitchy since x is handled first.
	-Collision abstractions are a mess
	-FPS prints to the console.
	-Compiled with Qt5.2.0
