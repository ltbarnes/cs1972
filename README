Project: Warmup1
Student: Logan Barnes (ltbarnes)

Global Reqs:

	First person camera support:
		Can be verified by running the game. The code is in the game/gamescreens/Playerscreen class and the engine/camera/Camera class.

	Screen Management:
		Virtual Screen is engine/screens/screen.h and game/gamescreens/playerscreen and game/gamescreens/menuscreen are the two gamescreens.

	Custom Graphics object:
		The engine/screens/Graphics object is handled by the engine/screens/Application class and passed to all onDraw methods.
		Most OpenGL Render methods are contained in the Graphics class


Game Reqs:
	
		Most of these can be verified by playing the game. Press "Enter" to advance passed the white box screen (hopefully a menu screen at some point).

		Most game logic is handled in the game/gamescreens/playerscreen class.


Issues:
	
	Text won't render when using the OpenGL core profile so the fps doesn't show up anymore :/ I'll try and find a library or something to render text if the QGL methods won't work.

	Some of the warmup 2 classes like Player, World, and ActionCamera are floating around but they aren't actually being used yet. Just adding to the clutter.

	The grass is reflective because it will actually be snow when the grass requirement is lifted.
