Project: Warmup2
Student: Logan Barnes (ltbarnes)


Common Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] Graphics object supports convenient drawing from a texture atlas
	### 

Voxel Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] Chunk-based world representation (implemented as a "manager")
[ ] Block defined as a 1x1x1 cube with (minimally) the following characteristics:
	[ ] Transparency - should the engine render block faces adjacent to this block?
	[ ] Passability - can entities pass through this block?
[ ] Chunk defined as a CxCxC group of blocks, where C is a single parameter (or 3 different ones) determining chunk dimensions
[ ] Chunks render only block faces that are adjacent to transparent blocks, with the exception of chunk boundaries, which may always be rendered

Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] Movement and view controls must the same as warmup
[ ] The world must have no gravity, so the player must have an additional key control to change their height
[ ] The terrain in the world must be procedurally generated
	[ ] Chunk composition is algorithmically determined with the complexity of at least a sin wave
	[ ] Terrain contains at least two visually unique blocks besides air/empty blocks
	[ ] All blocks must be textured from a single texture atlas
[ ] The world must consist of a 2x2x2 grid of size C = 32 chunks
[ ] The game must run at 20+ FPS on department machines: this requirement overrides the standard 30+ FPS requirement

Global requirements
========================================
[ ] Top-level handin directory contains a Qt project file, a README, and an INSTRUCTIONS file
[ ] README has a copy of the rubric with explanations of how to verify requirements
[ ] README documents any known bugs
[ ] README indicates number of hours taken
[ ] INSTRUCTIONS contains all information needed to play the game
[ ] Engine and game code logically separated
[ ] Engine code well designed
[ ] Game code well designed
[ ] Runs on department machines
[ ] Does not crash
[ ] Works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
[ ] Runs at 30+ UPS and never dips below 20 UPS unless indicated in the specific handout



Issues:
	
	FPS problems print to the console (only below 30 fps).
